# xstate-react-router

[XState](https://github.com/davidkpiano/xstate) connector to [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router).

Live examples:

- [Simple routing](https://codesandbox.io/s/ykmykxnm3z).
- A wizard (work in progress...), more complex use case.

# Roadmap

- [ ] Use React Hooks (#2).
- [ ] Create a wizard example.
- [ ] Add tests (#3).
- [ ] Lazy loading support (xstate splitting).

# xstate-react-router

[XState](https://github.com/davidkpiano/xstate) connector to [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router).

NB: This library is [no longer maintained](https://github.com/carloslfu/xstate-router/issues/25#issuecomment-682494116). The author recommends using [xstate-router](https://github.com/carloslfu/xstate-router/) instead, which is a complete routing library.

Live examples:

- [Simple routing](https://codesandbox.io/s/ykmykxnm3z).
- A wizard (work in progress...), more complex use case.

# Roadmap

- [ ] Use React Hooks [#2](https://github.com/carloslfu/xstate-react-router/issues/2).
- [ ] Create a wizard example.
- [ ] Add tests [#3](https://github.com/carloslfu/xstate-react-router/issues/3).
- [ ] Lazy loading support (xstate splitting).
